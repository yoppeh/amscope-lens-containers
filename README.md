Containers for AmScope lenses.

These are the (OpenScad)[https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html] files for lens containers I made for my AmScope microscope 
lenses. You can load these into OpenScad and generate the .STL files to print. You can also get the .STL files from 
[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3670163).
