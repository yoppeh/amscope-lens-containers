Containers for AmScope lenses.

These are the [OpenScad](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) files for lens containers I made for my AmScope microscope 
lenses. You can load these into OpenScad and generate the .STL files to print. You can also get the .STL files from 
[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3670163).

Warning: I have $fn set to 360 for these files. You might want to comment that out to work with them.
